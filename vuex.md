#What is Vuex?
Vuex is a state management pattern + library for Vue.js applications.

#What is a "State Management Pattern"?
A vue component is composed by 3 parts:
- The state, the source of truth that drives our app;
- The view, a declarative mapping of the state;
- The actions, the possible ways the state could change in reaction to user inputs from the view.

##State
Vuex uses a **single state tree** - that is, this single object contains all your application level state and serves as the "single source of truth."
